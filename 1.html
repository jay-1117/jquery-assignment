    <h1>1.      What is jQuery? </h1>
    <h2>Ans.    jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It simplifies things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development. jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications. It's widely used in web development due to its ease of use, cross-browser compatibility, and extensive plugin ecosystem. However, with the advancements in modern JavaScript and the development of browser APIs, jQuery's usage has declined in recent years, especially with the rise of frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js.</h2>
